# FPL-Prediction-Engine: A Deep Learning FPL Point Prediction Engine

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-blue)](https://github.com/[Your_Username]/[Your_Repo_Name])

A full-stack data science project to predict Fantasy Premier League player points using a deep neural network, with natural language insights generated by an LLM. This repository documents the project from data acquisition to a final, interactive web application.

## Core Idea

Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is a game of statistics, strategy, and foresight. While traditional analysis relies on simple metrics, this project aims to uncover deeper patterns in player performance. By leveraging historical data, we can train a neural network to forecast a player's point potential for the upcoming gameweek.

The goal is to go beyond simple numerical predictions and use a Language Model to translate these predictions into human-readable, actionable advice, mimicking the analysis of an expert FPL pundit.

## Project Roadmap

This project is being developed in distinct phases. Completed tasks will be checked off.

* **Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Engineering**
    * [ ] Develop a script to reliably extract data from the official FPL API.
    * [ ] Engineer predictive features, such as rolling performance averages and fixture difficulty.
    * [ ] Structure the data into a clean, model-ready format.

* **Phase 2: Predictive Modeling**
    * [ ] Design and build a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) using TensorFlow/PyTorch.
    * [ ] Establish a rigorous training and validation pipeline.
    * [ ] Train the model and evaluate its performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
    * [ ] Save the final trained model for inference.

* **Phase 3: LLM-Powered Insights**
    * [ ] Integrate a local, open-source LLM (e.g., Mistral, Gemma).
    * [ ] Develop a prompt-engineering strategy to convert model outputs (e.g., `Player: Salah, Predicted Points: 8.5`) into qualitative analysis.
    * [ ] Create the "Storyteller" module that generates weekly pick summaries.

* **Phase 4: Deployment & Presentation**
    * [ ] Build an interactive web application using Streamlit to display predictions.
    * [ ] Deploy the application to a public cloud platform (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces).
    * [ ] Finalize documentation and project write-up.

## Tech Stack

This project utilizes a modern stack for data science and machine learning.

| Area | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Handling** | `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy` |
| **Machine Learning** | `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch`, `Scikit-learn` |
| **LLM Integration** | `Hugging Face Transformers` |
| **Web Interface** | `Streamlit` |
| **Development** | `VS Code`, `Git`, `Jupyter`|

## Goals

This project serves as a practical application of key machine learning concepts and a centerpiece for my portfolio. The primary goals are:
1.  To build and train a deep learning model for a real-world regression task.
2.  To demonstrate skills in the complete MLOps lifecycle: from data gathering to deployment.
3.  To experiment with modern LLMs for augmenting traditional ML model outputs.
